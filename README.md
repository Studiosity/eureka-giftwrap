# Eureka Giftwrap

This is an ember-cli project to help pull ember addons into our sprockets based ember app. Under the hood it uses an addon called Giftwrap to produce an addon.js and addon.map that get pulled into eureka.

The versions of ember and ember-data must match what we are using in eureka otherwise the addons will not work.
